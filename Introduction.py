#Definition of OOP
# It is a way of organizing and structuring code that reflects 
#the real-world entities and their interactions. 
#In OOP, software is designed by creating classes and objects, 
#which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods or functions) into a single unit.

#Advantages/uses
#-Modularity; easier to manage and maintain code since each object is responsible 
             #for a specific aspect of the overall functionality.
#Reusability; You can create base classes with common attributes and methods, 
              #and then derive new classes from them to extend or specialize their functionality. 
               #This reduces code duplication and saves development time.
#Flexibility: OOP supports polymorphism, which enables 
              #the use of a single interface or method to work with objects of different classes.
#Maintainability: With OOP it is easier to understand and maintain code, 
                  #as objects and their interactions can be clearly defined and documented.
#Scalability:You can create new classes to represent new concepts and use existing classes 
             #as building block. This supports the development of scalable applications.
#Security: OOP allows for access control and data hiding through the use of private and
           #protected members within classes. This restricts unauthorized access to data and ensures better security.
#Community Support: Many popular programming languages, such as Java, C++, C#, and Python, support OOP.
                    #This means that there is a large and active community of developers, libraries, 
                     #and resources available to help with OOP-based projects.
#Real-world Modeling: OOP allows for the modeling of real-world entities and their 
                     #relationships in software. This makes the code more intuitive and easier to 
                     #understand for both developers and non-developers who are familiar with the domain.
#Ease of Testing: OOP promotes the use of encapsulation and abstraction, which makes it easier to isolate and 
          #test individual components (objects) of a system. This leads to more effective and efficient testing.
